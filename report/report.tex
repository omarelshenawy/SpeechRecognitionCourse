\chapter{Introduction}

Neural networks have always been an attractive area of research since 1960. The attempt at simulating the human brain has always been intriguing. Since the first perceptron model, Neural Networks have evolved in many ways, in which layers of perceptrons grew wider and deeper. However, until recently, it was only possible to train shallow networks, because of the vanishing gradient problem. The vanishing gradient is a phenomena where the error information starts to decay when propagated through many layers, and therefore the learning process is no longer doable. A remedy was made recently by Hinton**, in which the network is trained a layer at a time, instead of trying to train all layers at once.

Deep Neural Networks, or Deep Learning is the new trend in Machine Learning field. Recently, there has been many applications
