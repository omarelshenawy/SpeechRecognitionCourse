The Timit corpus contains 6300 \textbf{wav} files corresponding to the 6300 sentences uttered by the 630 different speakers. The \textbf{Sndfile} from \textbf{scikits.audiolab} library is used to read the \textbf{wav} files. Using the phones time alignment information, the frames of each phoneme are extracted and saved as \textbf{wav} files, resulting a \textbf{wav} for each phoneme. The \textbf{wav} files are then converted into spectrogram images using a script provided by \cite{pannous}.\\\\
