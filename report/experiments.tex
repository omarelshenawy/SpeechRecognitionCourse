The original 61 phonemes in the TIMIT corpus was mapped into 39 phonemes as suggested in {mapping}. This mapping is shown in table \ref{table:mapping}. The 39 phonemes are then used to both train and evaluate the model.

We have tried different networks with different data sets (train/validation split). As a proof of concept, we trained the network for only two phonemes. Figure~\ref{fig:twoClass} shows the graphs of training error and validation error as well as accuracy at each epoch for this network. Reaching 100\% accuracy after 5 epochs, suggested that our data representation, along with the chosen network architecture, was in deed capable of separating different classes. Figure~\ref{fig:best} shows a similar graph for our best performing method on all 39 classes.

Table~\ref{table:results} shows a detailed listing of the setup and performance of different experiments.
